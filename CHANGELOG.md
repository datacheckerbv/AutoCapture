# *CHANGELOG*

## *CHANGES* v6.0.0

- **Heatmap-driven detection pipeline**: Document inference now leverages heatmap-based corner extraction, exposing orientation and IoU scores for more reliable cropping.
- **Expanded quality checks**: Added straightness, corner completeness and occlusion validations to block poor frames before capture.
- **Unified AutoCapture and PaperCapture pipelines**: Shared base processing keeps ROI rendering, flip handling, and quality control consistent across modes.
- **Updated user messaging**: Language packs now include prompts for corner alignment, occlusion, and straightening while removing MRZ-specific alerts.
- **OpenCV WebAssembly upgrade**: Switched to the SIMD-enabled build and reorganized asset paths for faster preprocessing across supported browsers.

### Breaking Changes v6.0.0

- **MRZ** support removed: The MRZ detection and scanning functionality has been removed from the SDK. As a result, the following settings have been removed: `MRZ_SETTINGS`, `MRZ`.
- **Removed `onImage` callback**: The `onImage` callback hook is no longer emitted and must be removed from integrations.
- **Removed `ALWAYS_FLIP` setting**: Flip behaviour is handled automatically; the `ALWAYS_FLIP` configuration flag is no longer supported.
- **SIMD only**: The SDK now exclusively uses the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) version of WebAssembly for improved performance.

## *CHANGES* v5.1.1

- **Updated README**: The README file has been updated to include the latest changes and improvements in the SDK. See [Languages](README.md#languages) for the updated alert messages.
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved an issue where the SDK run into OOM (Out Of Memory) errors on certain devices during multiple instances of the SDK in the same environment. This fix ensures smoother performance and stability when using multiple instances.

## *CHANGES* v5.1.0

- **Improved processing time**: The processing time has been significantly reduced, resulting in faster image processing and detection.

- **PaperCapture support**: The SDK now supports capturing paper documents in addition to identity documents. (see [Configuration](README.md#configuration))
  - **Added `CAPTURE_BTN_AFTER` setting**: Enables a manual capture button, available for both AutoCapture and PaperCapture modes.
  - **Added `SDK_MODE` setting**: Allows configuration of the SDK mode as either `'autocapture'` or `'papercapture'` for tailored usage.

- **Enhanced user experience**:
  - **Tap to start after camera selection**: Now you are required to *tap to start* again after changing cameras, this is done to prevent the SDK from automatically resuming the capturing process.
  - **Improved focus detection**: Enhanced focus checks provide more reliable detection and faster processing.
  - **Better quality control**: Quality checks are now more targeted based on the selected SDK mode for improved accuracy.

- **Bug fixes and improvements**:
  - Improved frame processing efficiency for smoother performance.
  - Enhanced coordinate detection for more accurate document positioning.
  - Enhanced tutorial animations
  - Moved ML engine to separate Web Worker for improved memory management.

## *CHANGES* v5.0.1

- **Improved Camera Selection for iOS Triple Cameras**: Addressed issues with iPhones featuring three cameras, where automatic switching sometimes resulted in blurry images. The camera selection logic has been enhanced to reliably choose the correct camera based on the device's system language. Supported languages include: English, Dutch, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Slovak, Ukrainian, Czech, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Lithuanian, and Portuguese. For unsupported languages or devices other than iPhone with three cameras, the default back camera will be used.
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed an issue where coordinates in metadata were not returned correctly.

## *CHANGES* v5.0.0

- **Enhanced detection model**: The detection model has been upgraded to improve accuracy and performance, now supporting Sedula documents and providing better detection for Dutch Driving Licenses.
- **Disabled blur quality control**: The blur quality control has been removed from the detection process. See [Languages](README.md#languages) for the removed `blur` alert message.

### Breaking Changes v5.0.0

- **Removed face cropping**: The `CROP_FACE` functionality has been removed. Thus, the `'face'` output will no longer be present in the output.

## *CHANGES* v4.1.2

- **Enhanced detection model**: The detection model has been upgraded.
- **Improved blur detection**: Blur detection has been enhanced by leveraging higher resolution images, ensuring better image quality and more accurate detection results.

- **Blur alert change**: The "blur" alert has been updated. (see [Languages](README.md#languages))
- **iOS Pro phones zoom**: Implemented a 1.5x zoom on iOS Pro phones (3 lenses) to address focus issues caused by automatic camera switching.
- **Decreased consecutive good frames**: The number of consecutive good frames required has been decreased, resulting in faster capturing.
- **Version number display**: The version number is now visible on the screen, providing users with clear information about the current version of the application.

## *CHANGES* v4.1.1

- **Increased resolution**: The maximum resolution has been increased to 3840x2160 for sharper output images.
- **Output format change**: Changed the output format from PNG to JPEG to reduce the size of the output images.
- **Bug Fix**: Improved blur detection to enhance image quality.

## *CHANGES* v4.1.0

- **Enhanced detection model**: The detection model has been upgraded to support the latest NLD 2024 cards, offering improved accuracy and performance.

## *CHANGES* v4.0.3

This is a major update. If you are currently using version 3, there is a [migration guide](docs/migration_guide_v4.md) available to help you transition to version 4.

### Breaking Changes

- **Removal Crop card**: Removed the capability of cropping the card in the output image (`CROP_CARD`). The output image will be the roi area oriented to the card.
- **Internal OCR Removed**: The internal OCR has been removed due to performance concerns. However, hybrid OCR functionality remains available. Because of this, the following `MRZ_SETTINGS` are deprecated: [`FLIP`, `FLIP_EXCEPTION`, `FLIP_INCLUDE`, `OCR`, `RTW`]. As be seen, the `FLIP` configurations now moved from `MRZ_SETTINGS` to `ALLOWED_DOCUMENTS`.
- **Removal of `CAPTURE_BTN_AFTER`**: The `CAPTURE_BTN_AFTER` setting has been removed.
- **Removal of `GLARE_LIVE_CHECK`**: The `GLARE_LIVE_CHECK` setting has been removed. A glare check will always be performed.

### Improvements

- **New detection model**: Improved the detection model, it now will perform card detection and quality control.
- **New allowed documents setting**: You can now use the `ALLOWED_DOCUMENTS` setting to enable or disable flipping of certain documents. Please refer to the [ALLOWED DOCUMENTS](README.md#allowed-documents) section for more details.
